Dating pool size of UK heterosexual men as function of age and the ‘creepiness standard’ rule.

Implementation of [http://xkcd.com/314/](http://xkcd.com/314/) with [UK data](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9535).

Results maybe a bit optimistic (or pessimistic, depending on your utility function) due to the definition “single = alive unmarried non-widow”.
