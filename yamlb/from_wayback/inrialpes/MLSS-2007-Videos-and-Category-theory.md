The 2007 Machine Learning Summer School (Tübingen) is finished, which means that a lot of interesting videos are [online](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132746/http://videolectures.net/mlss07_tuebingen/).

For several months, I’ve been reading the (n-Category café)[https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132746/http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/], trying to get some intuitions about this “Generalized abstract nonsense” category theory stuff. And this is not an easy ride !

Anyway, David Corfield has an interesting [post](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132746/http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/09/category_theory_in_machine_lea.html) in which he proposes several possible “applications” of category theory to machine learning.

All of this seems very abstract (have a look [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132746/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category) to see what category theory can look like, :) ), but, quoting Kurt [Lewin](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132746/http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-lewin.htm), “There is nothing so practical as a good theory” !
