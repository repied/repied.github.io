[A. MIRANDA](http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/map/abhilash/) (researcher at the Machine Learning Group of the Université Libre de Bruxelles) proposes several PhD/post doc opportunities. More details [here](http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/mlg/research_positions.html).

I’ll probably post other announcements soon.

(even if, strictly speaking it’s not really in my own carrer interest to attract other candidates/competitors ;-) )
