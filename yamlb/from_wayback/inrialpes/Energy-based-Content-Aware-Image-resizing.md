In a SIGGRAPH 2007 paper, Shai Avidan, [Ariel Shamir](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132722/http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/) presents an amazing method for intelligent image resizing.

[DEMO]

Because the [original paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132722/http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il.nyud.net/arik/imret.pdf) is difficult to download (20Mb), I mirrored it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126132722/http://emotion.inrialpes.fr/~dangauthier/images/resizing2007.pdf).
