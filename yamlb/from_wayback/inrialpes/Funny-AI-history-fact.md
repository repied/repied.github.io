> About 1984, roughly 25 years later, at an annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), a vote was taken and it was decided that probability was in no way relevant to Artiticial Intelligence. A protest group quickly formed and the next year there was a workshop at the AAAI meeting devoted to Probability and Uncertainty in A.I. This workshop has continued to the present day to be a yearly event.

> well, that was before the era of Bayesian Networks when all probability driven methods were essentially ‘black box’ methods - so no explanations and hence not(AI).

> The Uncertainty in AI workshop was spun out from AAAI by John Lemmer and Peter Cheeseman in 1985. In 1988 we incorporated into a non-profit professional society, Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, which continues to this day, and is usually held just before the AAAI conference, as it is this year in Vancouver.

> Prior to the development of influence diagrams and its descendants, Bayesian networks and decision graphs, probability applications were “blackbox” in that they were systems of equations converted typically to a single piece of computer code.
>
>Changes required going back to the original equations and re-deriving new systems of equations based on local changes to the structural or probabilistic parameters.
>
> The development of influence diagrams and Bayesian Networks enabled local changes to be handled locally, visualized joint distributions, and enabled explanations of cause-effect events in terms of the topology of the networks.
