other hand when will we see real robots. Biological inspiration, analagogy, heuristic, no one understnad how the pb is solved. Fro instnca GA, but failed to solve moderate size problems (Koza)

Developmenatl robotics

It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of
getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified
and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into
darkness again; the never-satisfied man is so strange if he has completed a
structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order
to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after
one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.
Gauss, Karl Friedrich
Letter to Bolyai, 1808.

You know that I write slowly. This is chiefly because I am never satisfied
until I have said as much as possible in a few words, and writing briefly
takes far more time than writing at length.
Gauss, Karl Friedrich
In G. Simmons Calculus Gems, New York: McGraw Hill inc., 1992.
