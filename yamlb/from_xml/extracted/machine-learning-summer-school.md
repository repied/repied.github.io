MLSS Taipei 2006 is the 2006 version of the "Machine Learning
Summer School" series held previously in Canberra, Tubingen,
Berder and Chicago.

The two-week summer school program consists of about 40+ hours
of tutorial lectures from 7/24 to 8/4. The late afternoon
sessions will provide a chance for the participants
to discuss the latest research problems with the invited
speakers. This summer school will cover a broad range of
subjects from statistical learning theory to state of the art
applications. Please check the summer school Web site for the
topics covered and the list of invited speakers.
