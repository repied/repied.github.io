<blockquote>Bayesian Rationality: Bayesian rationality is a probabilistic approach to reasoning. Bayesian rationalists describe probability as the degree to which a person should believe a proposition. They also apply Bayes' theorem when inferring or updating their degree of belief when given new information. Some scientists and epistemologists hope to replace the Popperian view of proof with a Bayesian view.</blockquote>

Interesting in the sense that upgrading the Popperian true/false criteria to a continuous space of degree of beliefs require a shift to a subjective point of vue (the relative weight of prior vs likelihood is a part of the subjective prior).
