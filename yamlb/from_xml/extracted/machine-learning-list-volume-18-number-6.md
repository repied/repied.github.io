CALL FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
European Conference on Machine Learning
and European Conference on Principles and Practice of
Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML/PKDD 2009)

The purpose of this call is to invite groups interested in
hosting the next events in the ECML/PKDD conference series.
The ECML/PKDD conferences have been co-located since 2001,
and proposals that continue this tradition will be strongly
preferred. ECML/PKDD 2006 (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.ecmlpkdd2006.org/">http://www.ecmlpkdd2006.org/</a>)
will take place in Berlin, September 18-22,2006, ECML/PKDD 2007
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.ecmlpkdd2007.org/">http://www.ecmlpkdd2007.org/</a>) will take place in Warsaw,
Poland, September 17-21,2007.

All proposals will be presented and discussed at the business
meeting of ECML/PKDD 2006 in Berlin, which takes place on
Thursday, September 21, 2006. The community will then decide
upon the location and the chairs of the meeting in 2008, and
will discuss and provide feedback on expressions of interest
for organizing the meeting in 2009. Prior to the presentation
at the community meeting in Berlin, the ECML/PKDD Steering
Committee and the conference chairs of ECML/PKDD 2006 and
2007 will review the proposals and may provide informal feedback
to the organizers.

FORMAT OF PROPOSALS

Expressions of interest are informal and should briefly
describe the planned event, the location, and the organizing
committee.

Full proposals should address the following issues:

1. Proposed Dates
The conference should be scheduled for five days
(two days reserved mostly for workshops and tutorials;
three days for paper sessions and invited talks), preferably
in fall 2008.
2. Local Parameters
- Accessibility - Is it easy and inexpensive for people
(especially graduate students) to travel to the conference
site?  (Compute mean airfares from Europe, but also North
America, and Asia. Include ground transportation from relevant
airports to the site.)
- Meeting Rooms, AV Equipment, etc. - What are the physical
facilities like?  Consider rooms for plenary sessions, parallel
sessions, workshops, tutorials, and poster sessions.  What are
the charges, if any, for using them?
- Meals and Lodging - Is there low-cost, quality housing available
for attendees (especially graduate students)?  How far from the
meeting rooms?  Where will attendees eat?  Please estimate costs
for meals and lodging.
- Demo facilities - Will there be computing equipment and space
available to support demos?
- Other features - You may mention any other aspects of the site or
the region that are relevant.
3. Local ML/KDD Community. Is there a local ML or KDD group/community
that will be involved in the organization and funding?
4. Opportunities to co-locate with other conferences.
5. Organizational and Institutional Support. Is there a conference
office that can help with local arrangements?

Proposals should be addressed to the program chairs of ECML/PKDD
2006 (E-mail: <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pcchairs@ecmlpkdd2006.org">pcchairs@ecmlpkdd2006.org</a>)

Subject: Postdoctoral Position at Carnegie Mellon University

The School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University
has an opening for a post-doc in a new project focused on
the development of usable technologies that empower lay users
to effectively control privacy and security policies in
pervasive computing environments. This is an interdisciplinary
project that involves interacting with a number of faculty and
students and combines the development and evaluation of learning
and dialog technologies with the use of human-centered design
methodologies.

Prospective candidates are expected to have done graduate
work/have some familiarity with one or more of the following areas:
Learning and dialog technologies (e.g. conversational case-based
reasoning)
Mobile and Pervasive Computing
Web Security and Privacy
Human Computer Interaction

Candidates are expected to be capable of working under limited
supervision and should have strong communication skills. They
are also expected to have strong Java programming skills and
have experience collaborating with others in the context of
large-scale software development projects. Actual work is expected
to involve a mix of conceptual design, software development and
field evaluation with human subjects. The successful candidate is
expected to publish papers in top level conferences and journals
along with other faculty and students.

Initial appointments are for one year with option of renewal. The
start date is negotiable and can be anytime during the second half
of 2006, with a preference for an early start.

Carnegie Mellon offers competitive salaries and benefits.

Interested candidates should forward their resume along with the
names of three references by email, fax, or snail mail to:

Subject: Postdoctoral Position in Computational Sensorimotor Integration

An enthusiastic and well-qualified post-doctoral researcher is
required to work in the wide area of computational sensorimotor
integration in the laboratory of Konrad Koerding at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago, Northwestern University, Chicago.  The research
in the laboratory focuses on the question how people combine
information from several sensors to allow them to move efficiently.
Towards this aim new Bayesian models are developed and tested using
human psychophysics. The successful applicant will be expected to work
on computational models and experimental studies in humans.

Applicants should have a PhD and skills relevant to machine learning,
Bayesian statistics or computational neuroscience and an interest
in the way the nervous system solves computational problems; however,
applicants with a strong background in psychophysics who wish to learn
computational approaches will also be considered. Experience with
Matlab would be very advantageous.

The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC) boasts a large
concentration of researchers that address various questions
about movement in healthy and patient populations. The
department of physiology hosts many scientists probing the
neural basis of movement.

Informal inquiries can be addressed by email to Professor Konrad
Koerding (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:konrad@koerding.com">konrad@koerding.com</a>). For more information about the
environment see the Web Pages of the Rehabilitation Institute of
Chicago (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.ric.org/">www.ric.org</a>), the Northwestern Department of Physiology
(<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.physio.northwestern.edu/">www.physio.northwestern.edu</a>) and the Northwestern Department of
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.northwestern.edu/pmr/">www.northwestern.edu/pmr/</a>).

The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago is an Affirmative
Action - Equal Opportunity Employer. Applicants are considered for
all positions, and employees are treated during employment without
regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age,
marital or veteran status, the presence of a non-job-related medical
condition, disability, sexual orientation, or any other legally
protected status to the extent required by law. The Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago embraces diversity in its work force. The
position is available from October 2006 for one year in the
first instance.

Applicants should supply:
- one-page statement of research interests
- Copy of CV (two if sent by post)
- Names and contact details of three references

These posts are suitable for both holders of a doctorate degree
who wish to pursue a post doc and for graduates who wish to pursue
a Ph.D. For the former case, the prospective candidate should have
a Ph.D. in Computer Science and a number of good quality publications.
For the latter case, the prospective candidate should have a B.Sc.
and preferably also a  M.Sc. in Computer Science and evidence of
commitment to  research. In both cases, the candidate should be
sufficiently familiar in one or  more of the following areas:
Software Engineering, Parallel and Distributed Systems, Mobile
Systems, Component-Based Software Development and Middleware
Platforms, Internet and Service-Oriented Computing.
