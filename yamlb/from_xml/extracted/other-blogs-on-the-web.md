I read ML blogs on the web, all really interesting:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://hunch.net">hunch.net</a> John Langford</li>
	<li><a href="http://ml.typepad.com">ml.typepad.com</a> Olivier Bousquet</li>
	<li><a href="http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com">yaroslavvb.blogspot.com</a> Yaroslav Bulatov</li>
</ul>

I found others, but not updated. Am I missing interesting ones ?
