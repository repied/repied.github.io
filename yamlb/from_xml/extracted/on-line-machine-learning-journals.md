On-line and freely available papers are more cited than others, espetially in the computer science community. For instance, <a target="_blank" href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/">JMLR</a> is online since 2000.

I discovered today another on line journal, <a target="_blank" title="JMLG" href="http://www.jmlg.org/">JMLG</a>. It would be shameful to miss its reading.
