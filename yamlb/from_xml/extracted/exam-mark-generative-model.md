Today, I corrected exams of my students, and as the class exams are divided into 3 teachers, we have to make the fusion of our marks. usually  we just compute the 3 average marks and add the required nu opf po,its to each copies in ordrer to have the sameaverage mak.

But tjos is unfair, what is the best procedure ? certainly the one who refelecst the stuednt skill, what they learn

une ltterature extensive but

evaluate skill from marks
