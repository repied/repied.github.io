Here are some slides of a <a id="p30" href="../../media/dangauthierTeamMeetingApril06.pdf">presentation</a> I made this morning, introducing bayesian learning. I have also copied/pasted some material from this blog (so nothing is really new).

Outline:
<ul>
	<li>Machine learning</li>
	<li>Philosophy of probability</li>
	<li>Bayesian Learning</li>
	<li>3 debates in machine learning</li>
	<li>Entropy maximization</li>
</ul>
