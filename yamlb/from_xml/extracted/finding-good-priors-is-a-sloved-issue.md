<blockquote><strong>Q.  What is the Bayesian Conspiracy?</strong>
A.  The Bayesian Conspiracy is a multinational,
interdisciplinary, and shadowy group of scientists
that controls publication, grants, tenure, and the
illicit traffic in grad students.  The best way to be
accepted into the Bayesian Conspiracy is to join the
Campus Crusade for Bayes in high school or college,
and gradually work your way up to the inner circles.
It is rumored that at the upper levels of the Bayesian
Conspiracy exist nine silent figures known only as the
Bayes Council.

<strong>Q.  How can I find the priors for a problem?</strong>
A.  Many commonly used priors are listed in the
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.

<strong>Q.  Where do priors originally come from?</strong>
A.  Never ask that question.

<strong>Q.  Uh huh.  Then where do scientists get their priors?</strong>
A.  Priors for scientific problems are established by
annual vote of the AAAS.  In recent years the vote has
become fractious and controversial, with widespread
acrimony, factional polarization, and several outright
assassinations.  This may be a front for infighting
within the Bayes Council, or it may be that the
disputants have too much spare time.  No one is really
sure.

<strong>Q.  I see.  And where does everyone else get their priors?</strong>
A.  They download their priors from Kazaa.

<strong>Q.  What if the priors I want aren't available on Kazaa?</strong>
A.  There's a small, cluttered antique shop in a back
alley of San Francisco's Chinatown.  Don't ask about
the bronze rat.

<strong>Q.  Why did the Bayesian reasoner cross the road?</strong>
A.  You need more information to answer this question.

<strong>Q.  Are there any limits to the power of Bayes' Theorem?</strong>
A.  According to legend, one who fully grasped Bayes'
Theorem would gain the ability to create and
physically enter an alternate universe using only
off-the-shelf equipment and a short computer program.
One who fully grasps Bayes' Theorem, yet remains in
our universe to aid others, is known as a Bayesattva.</blockquote>
