In the machine learning/artificial intelligence field, conferences are as important as journals. Maybe even more important.

Having a good publication list is crutial for a researcher, for getting a PhD degree, finding a postdoc, a job, a grant, being promoted, becoming famous and ultimately getting married. (I'm not sure for the last one, does anybody have ever dated a grirl thanks to his publication history?).

Anyway, "recuiters" have to rank candidates. So they have to rank conferences. Such a conference ranking will always be fuzzy and controversial, but here are several temptatives. The first one, done by autralian university seems to me the most serious.  The "Top 6 list" are in the field of machine learning/Artifical intelligence/computer vision/pattern recognition depending on the ranking method.
