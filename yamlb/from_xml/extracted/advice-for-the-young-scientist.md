To change from bayesian statistics, I found this page dealing with some <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/advice.html">Advice for the Young Scientist</a>, written by John Baez in 2003.
Citation:
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Keep your soul</li>
	<li>Go to the most prestigious school.</li>
	<li>Work with the best possible advisor</li>
	<li>Publish.</li>
	<li>Go to conferences.</li>
	<li>Give Good Talks</li>
</ul></blockquote>
